The problem of clustering records that correspond to the same real world entities is a
notoriously old and difficult problem.
The recent explosion of user generated content has made resolving these entities more difficult to
% These data sets have a variety of sizes and properties.
scale.
In this work we identify various techniques researchers have presented to score and process
collections of entities.
We then analyze the benefits of each technique.
We then introduce a hybrid storage structure that efficiently stores and processes clusters of 
data in a manner agnostic to the exact entity resoliton algorithm.
We examine XXX of the largest available entity resoltion data set and we show that this storage 
method is simple and extremly efficient.
