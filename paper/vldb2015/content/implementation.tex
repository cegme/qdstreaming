\section{Implementation}

In this section we first present a microbenchmark to validate our invsitgation of entity approximation and compression.
We then discuss the implementation of the compression and approximation techniques over a large real-world
cross-document coreference corpus.

\subsection{Microbenchmark}
\label{sec:microbenchmark}
We created a synthetic experiment to measure the
affect entity sizes have on the proposal computation.
