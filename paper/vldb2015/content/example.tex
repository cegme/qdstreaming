\section{Problem Statement}

We have two problems.
First,
Given an Entity $\mathcal{E}$ how can we create a
a structure with minimal total size.
Second, How can we incrementally add and remove items 
from the compressed structure.
Third, how can we iterate over or sample from the
compressed data structure to perform uncompression.




Show Distribution of Entity sizes in the data set

We can take advantage of the redundancy within
large entities and compress the entities.

We look to perform add, remove and iterate operations
over the compressed entity sets.
