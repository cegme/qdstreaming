\section{Algorithms}

In this section we will describe XXX algorithms for entity sampling.
The main method we use to improve the computation speed is to reduce the
number of comparisons we make for large entity clusters.
We additionally discuss methods to improve the performance of algorithms
over time by collecting statistics from the processes.

\textbf{Random Iterator.} This method shuffles the mentions in both the
source and destination entity clusters when doing pairwise comparisons. 

\textbf{Sorted Iterator.} This method sorts them mentions in both the source
and destination entity clusters when performing pairwise comparisons.

\textbf{SubSample Iterator.} This method only samples $M$ mentions from the
source and destination entities clusters when performing pairwise comparisons.

\textbf{Top-K SubSample Iterator.} This method uses a priority queue to sort
the mentions and only performs comparisons for the first $M$ values.

\textbf{Blocked Iterator.} This method performs blocking on the mentions in the
source and destination entities and takes the average gain from pairwise
comparisons inside each block .


Further, We examine active learning techniques to adjust threshold sizes based on statistics collected while running the algorithms.
