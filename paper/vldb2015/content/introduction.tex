% What is the problem
The storage of user generated content within systems has introduced 
vast amounts of data.
To clean the dump an important task is entity resolution.
Entity Resolution (ER) is the problem of resolving the records in
a data set that correspond the same real world entity.

% Why is the problem hard
Entity resolution is a notoriously computationally difficult problem.
Several efforts in different domains have made outstanding progress~\cite{}.
The main issues still affecting runtimes of ER systems are
twofold, first, the computation of large entities and second, excessive
computation spent resolving unambiguous entities.
Optimization that touches these difficult points is wholly understudied.
Amdahl's argument suggests that compression and approximation 
techniques can efficiently decrease the runtimes of traditional ER systems.

% What are the technical challenges and validation
Some recently, researchers have suggest methods of compressing entities.
