\section{Problem Statement}

In this section we formally define the compression problem for
entity resolution.

We have two problems.
First, Given an Entity $\mathcal{E}$ how can we create a
a structure with minimal total size.
Second, How can we incrementally add and remove items 
from the compressed structure.
Third, how can we iterate over or sample from the
compressed data structure to perform uncompression.

The total entity size entity is 

$$ \sum_i C + (sizeof(int) * |m_i|) $$  

The smallest compression we can do per entitiy is to only unique entity tokens.

The compressed total entity size size is

$$ \sum_i c + (sizeof(int) * \#(m_i) ) $$ 


Show Distribution of Entity sizes in the data set

We can take advantage of the redundancy within
large entities and compress the entities.

We look to perform add, remove and iterate operations
over the compressed entity sets.
