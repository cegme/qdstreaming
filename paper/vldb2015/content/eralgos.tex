In this section we give a short overview of the different entity resolution algorithms found in literature.
This is not an exhaustive list; we classify the list into classes of algorithms and discuss one of the algorithms from each of the classes.


% Algorithms Features
% - Supervised/Unsupervised
% - Approximate/Exact
% - Collective/Pairwise
% - Batch/Iterative
% - Joint/Isolated
% - Distributed/Standalone
% - Deterministic/Nondeterministic
% - Static/Streaming
% - Query-Aware/Query-Agostic 

% For each describe
% - 1) The definitions of each
% - 2) The pros and cons of each approach
% - 3) A suggestion for the best option

% Create a comparison table for each of the approaches and add where each pubication applies fall
