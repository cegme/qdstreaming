% RDD

We introduce a distributed structure that adapts to the changing and diverse requirements 
of entity resolution.

Has the following properties:

1) This systems enables adaptable column compression when needed.
  - For example large entities will be compressed
2) Fast updates for streaming 
  - Updates to entities is an amortized $\Theta(1)$ operation
3) Efficient Book keeping for fast approximate methods
  - Keep Approximate counts for the size of entities, the number of terms, etc
4) Efficient Distributed structure
  - Based on the RDD structure
5) Support for query aware techniques
  - Book Keeping makes it easy to perform query specific clustering
