In this section we discuss the data structures involved in entity resolution.
While most methods have several auxillary structures we focus on the main structures
for storing and organizing entities and records.


%1) Array of Arrays (http://fastutil.di.unimi.it/docs/it/unimi/dsi/fastutil/BigArrays.html)
%2) Array Mentions and Array of Entities (Database?)
%3) Full Connected Graph (GraphLab/GraphX)
%4) Hierarchical tree (Wick et al)
%5) Compressed structure (Spark SQL/sci.py)
%6) RDBMS Tables (PostgreSQL/Grokit)
