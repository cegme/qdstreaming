\textbf{Factor Graphs.}
Factor graphs are a pairwise formalism for expressing arbitrarily complex
relationships between random variables.
A factor graph $\mathcal{F}$, will contain a set of random variables, $r$
and a set of factors $f$. Random variables are connected to eachother
through factors. Factors represent a mapping of the relationship to a 
real valued number.


\textbf{Markov Chain Monte Carlo Metropolis Hastings.}
Inference over complex factors graphs is computationally prohibitive.
Therefore, it is popular for researchers to use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) 
approximation techniques to estimate probability values.
In particular, for large dense factor graphs MCMC Metropolis Hastings has
been shown to be a scalable and efficive technique for 
inference calculation~\cite{singh2011large}.

\textbf{Cross-Document Coreference.}

Cross-Document coreference come in a variety of techniques.

We model entity resolution as a factor graph for flexibility and the ability
to generalize the mathematical model.
The inference for these large dense graphical models are computationally
intractable therefore it is typical to use approximate methods such as MCMC-MH\@.


The distribution of entity sizes
In large text corpora, the sizes of entities follows the power law~\cite{singh12:wiki-links}.
This data set contains 40 million mentions and 3 million entities 
over 11 million web pages.

In this data set XX percent of mentions are smaller that 100 mentions in size.
Additionally, YY percent of entities contain more than 1000 mentions.

Doing pairwise comparison over clusters is $O(n^2)$.
For clusters larger than 1000 mentions calculating scores of the model
becomes extremely expensive.
Performing sophisticated techniques over smaller clusters could also 
add extra over head.

In this paper, we examine the trade-off of selecting techniques to
accelerate the feature computation process.

Wick et al perform hierarchal compression of entities~\cite{Wick:2012:DHM:2390524.2390578}.


As we see, in Section~\ref{sec:microbenchmark} the entity sizes have a
large effect on the factor computation size.
