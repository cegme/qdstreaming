\section{Summary}

In this paper, we describe an initial approach for optimizing sampling for the entity resolution process.
We begin to develop an optimizer that attacks two major limitations, the size of the entities and the redundant computation.
This paper motivated the need for the optimizer and examined the feasibility of its treation.
We plan to implement the full optimizer over a large, streaming corpus, with resolved entities.
We hope to soon have a fully resolved TREC streamcorpus\footnote{\url{http://trec-kba.org/kba-stream-corpus-2014.shtml}} and examine the performance of the optimizer of that large data set.
