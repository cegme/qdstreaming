# Cpp test for close and far samples


# FileBackedMatrix.cpp
    
    gcc FileBackedMatrix.cpp -g -lm

# Running tests

Here is an example run

    ./a.out -d 0.1 -s 1000000 -c 500 -r 50000 -f /tmp/mymatrix.mat

The command line paramters are the following:

  `-s` The number of samples
  `-d` The distance window
  `-c` The number of columns
  `-r` The number of rows 
  `-f` The file for the matrix


Next, I will write a script to run hundreds of these test and extract
and average the results.
